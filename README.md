# *Digital VLSI SoC Design and Planning*
Welcome to the OpenLane workshop! In this workshop, we will delve into the process of designing an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) from the Register Transfer Level (RTL) to the Graphical Data System (GDS) file using the OpenLane ASIC flow. The flow is composed of several key steps, starting with an RTL file and culminating in a GDS file.

## Inception of open-source EDA, OpenLANE and sky130 PDK

VSDSquadron is a cutting-edge development board based on the RISC-V architecture that is fully open-source.This board presents an exceptional opportunity for individuals to learn about RISC-V and VLSI chip design utilizing only open-source tools, starting from the RTL and extending all the way to the GDSII. The possibilities for learning and advancement with this technology are limitless.RISC-V chips on these boards should be open for VLSI chip design learning, allowing you to explore Place&Route (PNR), standard cells, and layout design. The Caravel IC is a microprocessor chip that interfaces with other components on the board. The design of this chip, from the abstract level down to fabrication, is accomplished through the RTL-to-GDSII flow. The VSDsquadron consists of both a physical programmable circuit board (often referred to as a microcontroller) and software, or an IDE (Integrated Development Environment), that runs on a computer and is used to write and upload code to the physical board.
